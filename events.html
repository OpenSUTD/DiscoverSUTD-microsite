						<h1 id="intro-arduino-soar">Introduction to Arduino</h1>
						<h4>Organised by SUTD Organisation of Autonomous Robotics (SOAR)</h4>
					</header>
					<p>
						<b>Ever wondered how an Arduino works? </b><br><br>

						An Arduino is a user-friendly programmable single-board microcontroller that allows users to
						interact with electronic parts with an easy plug and play system.<br><br>

						In this session, we share with you what makes this device easy to prototype with and experience
						hands-on sessions with how we can interact with it to operate and control Servo Motors,
						Ultrasound Sensors, and Light Emitting Diodes (LEDs).<br><br>

						Participants would be grouped into small teams of 3/4 members each and assigned an Arduino
						developmental kit.<br>
						Participants need not have any prior knowledge as the workshop is guided.<br>
						Takeaway skills: <em>Arduino Programming</em>, <em>Arduino Circuit Boarding</em><br><br>

						There are 3 activities are designed to be hands-on learning based to guide the participants on
						the ease in operating and controlling the provided equipment.<br><br>

						The breakdown of the activities are given below:<br><br>

						<u>Activity 1: Light Them Up!: LEDs</u><br>
						- Warm-up activity session to highlight the concepts required for electronic circuit boarding
						and wiring of LEDs<br>
						- Work through code/libraries to bring participants up to speed about the Arduino coding syntax
						and thought process of transferring idea to code<br><br>

						<u>Activity 2: Sense The World! - Ultrasound Sensors</u><br>
						- Participants will learn about the feedback outputs by Ultrasound Sensors and<br>
						- Learn to apply them in feedback loops to simulate interaction of a robotic vehicle with the
						environment through the addition of obstacle avoidance<br><br>


						<u>Activity 3: Move On Command! - Servo Motors</u><br>
						Servos are controllable motors that can rotate precisely, usually from a range of 0Â° to 180Â°<br>
						- Participants will first learn how to control a Servo and<br>
						- Implement the feedback received from Ultrasound Sensors (in Activity 2) to control said servo
