      <google-codelab-step label="DiscoverPeople: Human Library" duration="5">
        <p>A <strong>Human Library</strong> allows <strong>YOU </strong>to borrow &#34;books&#34;. These books are real people: faculty, staff, researchers and seniors. When you borrow a book, you sit down with them and have a conversation about their experiences both inside and outside of SUTD.</p>
<p class="image-container"><img style="width: 428.50px" src="img/280f29a356c49f1b.jpeg"></p>
<p>Every single book will have a <strong>bio</strong> that gives you an idea of what conversation topics you might expect! You can read all bios right <a href="https://discover.sutd.dev/bio.html" target="_blank">here</a> and find out where your favourite book is seated at the event venue (TBC).</p>
<p>During the Human Library, you can expect to gain unique insights into the various aspects of being a part of the SUTD community, as well as the work experiences and lessons learnt by faculty/researchers throughout their careers, giving you a better understanding of the wider world.</p>
<aside class="special"><p>Human Library will take place on <strong>Wednesday, 22nd May</strong> at the <strong>Campus Center</strong>!

      <google-codelab-step label="Food places if you&#39;re hungry" duration="5">
        <p>Food is one of the things that matter to us the most! Within the school, there are a few eateries that students go to if they fancy something outside the canteen.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>GomGom</strong> (Sub/Sandwich cafe)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 8pm (weekdays) 12pm to 6pm (Sunday)</li>
<li><strong>Crooked Cooks </strong>(Western and Japanese restaurant with a bar)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 11pm (weekdays) 10am to 10pm (Saturday)</li>
<li><strong>D&#39;Cafe</strong> (Asian-Western fusion)<br>Opening Hours: 9am to 8pm (weekdays)</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of restaurants at <strong>Changi City Point</strong> (CCP) offers food at prices that are friendlier for students. CCP is within walking distance, one MRT stop away (Expo MRT). There is also a shuttle bus that runs at 30 minute intervals (starting at 11:15am and ending at 7:45pm).</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Soup Spoon Union<br></strong>Offers student meals at $6.90<br>Student meal hours: Mondays to Fridays, until 6:30pm</li>
<li><strong>Wolf Burgers<br></strong>Burgers and a meal at 10% student discount</li>
</ul>
<p>Fancy heading out a bit further? Want to treat yourself to a job well done? A mere two MRT stops away (and with no transfers required) is Tampines, with the following excellent (if a bit hard on your wallet) food places: (Note: the list is not exhaustive)</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>iSteaks<br></strong>Estimated Price: about 15~20 dollars per person, including drinks</li>
<li><strong>老火汤<br></strong>Estimated Price: about 20~25 dollars per person, for a full meal</li>
<li><strong>Fat Papa&#39;s<br></strong>Estimated Price: about ~20 dollars per person, for a meal</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Jewel@Changi Airport </strong>(closest thing to paradise itself)</p>
<p>Blogs such as <a href="https://thesmartlocal.com/read/jewel-changi" target="_blank">TheSmartLocal</a>, <a href="https://www.timeout.com/singapore/things-to-do/the-ultimate-guide-to-jewel-changi-airport" target="_blank">TimeOut</a>, and <a href="https://danielfooddiary.com/2019/04/13/jewelchangi/" target="_blank">DanielFoodDiary</a> have written so much about Jewel. Guess what? We&#39;re literally two MRT stops away! If we were to list the number of restaurants it would take up the rest of the page... so we&#39;ll leave you to explore it yourself!</p>

      <google-codelab-step label="Student Housing Tips" duration="0">
        <p>There are three housing blocks for students: Block 59 (nearest to campus), Block 57 (middle) and Block 55 (furthest from campus). Block 59 and Block 55 have nice rooftop areas on L12 with great views and some benches.</p>
<h2 is-upgraded>Facilities</h2>
<ul>
<li>Tip for rooms: the lowered blinds near the room door tends to rattle continuously. Tape them down for a good night&#39;s sleep!</li>
<li>There are many housing facilities that you can book!<br>Just go to the <a href="https://hms.sutd.edu.sg/" target="_blank">housing portal</a> to find out more.</li>

      <google-codelab-step label="Getting Around Campus" duration="0">
        <p>After some time in school, you would realise that rooms in our school are often referred to using code numbers (e.g. 2.506). Here&#39;s a quick breakdown of what this code means to ease getting yourself around:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>(#</strong>.___) The number at the left of the decimal represents the building where the room may be found.</li>
<li>Building 1 is where the library may be found</li>
<li>Building 2 is where the campus center may be found</li>
<li>Building 3 is opposite the campus center, where GongCha may be found</li>
<li>Building 5 is where the FabLab may be found</li>
<li>(_.<strong>####) </strong>For the number at the right of the decimal, the first digit represents the floor where the building may be found, and the other two numbers represent the room number.</li>
<li><strong>TL;DR: The format of the room code is [Building].[Floor][Room] so for example 2.504 references a room in Building 2, Level 5, Room 4.</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>Also, if you need to go across buildings, the following levels are interconnected in this fashion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Level 2: The second floor of the Campus Centre links Buildings 2 and 3.</li>
<li>Level 3: The roof area above the Campus Centre links Buildings 1,2, and 3. An additional link bridge links Buildings 1 and 2 in the middle of Building 1. A final link bridge hidden along Building 1 links Buildings 1 and 5.</li>
<li>Level 5: The link bridge roof is walkable and links Buildings 1 and 2.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Hostel meeting room/study room</li>
<li>Hostel rooftop</li>
<li>Library (there are discussion rooms on Level 2)</li>
<li>Pi Lab (located beside the printing room at Building 1 Level 5)</li>
